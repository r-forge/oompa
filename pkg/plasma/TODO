1. Extend the selection "[" operator for MultiOmics objects. use the
first argument 'i" to select data sets and the second argument [j] to
select samples.

2. Test "predict" methods on new data subset. (Split in a consistent
way into train and test.)

3. Figure out a convenient way to plot the split-risk model when
predicting outcomes on new data from a SingleModel.
