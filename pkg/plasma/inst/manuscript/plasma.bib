   abstract = {Single-cell omics technologies are currently solving biological and medical problems that earlier have remained elusive, such as discovery of new cell types, cellular differentiation trajectories and communication networks across cells and tissues. Current advances especially in single-cell multi-omics hold high potential for breakthroughs by integration of multiple different omics layers. To pair with the recent biotechnological developments, many computational approaches to process and analyze single-cell multi-omics data have been proposed. In this review, we first introduce recent developments in single-cell multi-omics in general and then focus on the available data integration strategies. The integration approaches are divided into three categories: early, intermediate, and late data integration. For each category, we describe the underlying conceptual principles and main characteristics, as well as provide examples of currently available tools and how they have been applied to analyze single-cell multi-omics data. Finally, we explore the challenges and prospective future directions of single-cell multi-omics data integration, including examples of adopting multi-view analysis approaches used in other disciplines to single-cell multi-omics.},

   abstract = {Multi-omics studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: A vast literature from the past decade is devoted to relating gene profiles and subject survival or time to cancer recurrence. Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data, such as transcriptomic or single nucleotide polymorphism profiles, is a major challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses. The proportional hazard regression model suggested by Cox (1972), to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data. However, like multivariate regression, it supposes that more observations than variables, complete data, and not strongly correlated variables are available. In practice, when dealing with high-dimensional data, these constraints are crippling. Collinearity gives rise to issues of over-fitting and model misidentification. Variable selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation. To deal with both collinearity and variable selection issues, many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional hazards have been proposed since the reference paper of Tibshirani. Regularization could also be performed using dimension reduction as is the case with partial least squares (PLS) regression. We propose two original algorithms named sPLSDR and its non-linear kernel counterpart DKsPLSDR, by using sparse PLS regression (sPLS) based on deviance residuals. We compared their predicting performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark datasets. RESULTS: sPLSDR and DKsPLSDR compare favorably with other methods in their computational time, prediction and selectivity, as indicated by results based on benchmark datasets. Moreover, in the framework of PLS regression, they feature other useful tools, including biplots representation, or the ability to deal with missing data. Therefore, we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction methods for the widely used Cox's model in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings.

   abstract = {Fitting Cox models in a big data context -on a massive scale in terms of volume, intensity, and complexity exceeding the capacity of usual analytic tools-is often challenging. If some data are missing, it is even more difficult. We proposed algorithms that were able to fit Cox models in high dimensional settings using extensions of partial least squares regression to the Cox models. Some of them were able to cope with missing data. We were recently able to extend our most recent algorithms to big data, thus allowing to fit Cox model for big data with missing values. When cross-validating standard or extended Cox models, the commonly used criterion is the cross-validated partial loglikelihood using a naive or a van Houwelingen scheme -to make efficient use of the death times of the left out data in relation to the death times of all the data. Quite astonishingly, we will show, using a strong simulation study involving three different data simulation algorithms, that these two cross-validation methods fail with the extensions, either straightforward or more involved ones, of partial least squares regression to the Cox model. This is quite an interesting result for at least two reasons. Firstly, several nice features of PLS based models, including regularization, interpretability of the components, missing data support, data visualization thanks to biplots of individuals and variables -and even parsimony or group parsimony for Sparse partial least squares or sparse group SPLS based models, account for a common use of these extensions by statisticians who usually select their hyperparameters using cross-validation. Secondly, they are almost always featured in benchmarking studies to assess the performance of a new estimation technique used in a high dimensional or big data context and often show poor statistical properties. We carried out a vast simulation study to evaluate more than a dozen of potential cross-validation criteria, either AUC or prediction error based. Several of them lead to the selection of a reasonable number of components. Using these newly found cross-validation criteria to fit extensions of partial least squares regression to the Cox model, we performed a benchmark reanalysis that showed enhanced performances of these techniques. In addition, we proposed sparse group extensions of our algorithms and defined a new robust measure based on the Schmid score and the R coefficient of determination for least absolute deviation: the integrated R Schmid Score weighted.

   abstract = {With the advancement of next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry, there is a growing need for the ability to merge biological features in order to study a system as a whole. Features such as the transcriptome, methylome, proteome, histone post-translational modifications and the microbiome all influence the host response to various diseases and cancers. Each of these platforms have technological limitations due to sample preparation steps, amount of material needed for sequencing, and sequencing depth requirements. These features provide a snapshot of one level of regulation in a system. The obvious next step is to integrate this information and learn how genes, proteins, and/or epigenetic factors influence the phenotype of a disease in context of the system. In recent years, there has been a push for the development of data integration methods. Each method specifically integrates a subset of omics data using approaches such as conceptual integration, statistical integration, model-based integration, networks, and pathway data integration. In this review, we discuss considerations of the study design for each data feature, the limitations in gene and protein abundance and their rate of expression, the current data integration methods, and microbiome influences on gene and protein expression. The considerations discussed in this review should be regarded when developing new algorithms for integrating multi-omics data.},

   abstract = {In the domain of chemometrics and multivariate data analysis, partial least squares (PLS) modelling is a widely used technique. PLS gains its beauty by handling the high collinearity found in multivariate data by replacing highly covarying variables with common subspaces spanned by orthogonal latent variables. Furthermore, all can be achieved with simple steps of linear algebra requiring minimal computation power and time usage compared to current high-end computing and substantial hyperparameter tuning required by methods such as deep learning. PLS can be used for a wide variety of tasks, for example, single block modelling, multiblock modelling, multiway data modelling and for task such as regression and classification. Furthermore, new PLS based approaches can also incorporate meta information to improve the PLS subspace extraction. However, in the current scenario, there is a wide range of separate tools and codes available to perform different PLS tasks. Often when the user needs to perform a new PLS task, they need to start with a separate mathematical implementation of the PLS techniques. This study aims to provide a single solution, i.e., the Swiss knife PLS (SKPLS) modelling approach to enable a single mathematical implementation to perform analyses of single block, multiblock, multiway, multiblock multiway, multi-response, and incorporation of meta information in PLS modelling. It contains all that is needed for any PLS practitioner to perform both classification and regression tasks. The SKPLS backbone is the stepwise PLS strategy called response oriented sequential alternation (ROSA) which we generalize to enable all the mentioned analysis possibilities. The basic structure of the algorithm is highlighted, and some example cases of performing single block, multiblock, multiway, multiblock multiway, multi-response PLS modelling and the incorporation of meta information in PLS modelling are included.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing and biotechnological methodologies have led to the generation of large volumes of molecular data of different omics layers, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. Integration of these data with clinical information provides new opportunities to discover how perturbations in biological processes lead to disease. Using data-driven approaches for the integration and interpretation of multi-omics data could stably identify links between structural and functional information and propose causal molecular networks with potential impact on cancer pathophysiology. This knowledge can then be used to improve disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and therapy. This review will summarize and categorize the most current computational methodologies and tools for integration of distinct molecular layers in the context of translational cancer research and personalized therapy. Additionally, the bioinformatics tools Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA) and netDX will be tested using omics data from public cancer resources, to assess their overall robustness, provide reproducible workflows for gaining biological knowledge from multi-omics data, and to comprehensively understand the significantly perturbed biological entities in distinct cancer types. We show that the performed supervised and unsupervised analyses result in meaningful and novel findings.},
